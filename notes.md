#Meter notes

##Collections
> On the client side when you declared a new collection what you are doing is creating a local client-side cache of the real Mongo collection. It's only a subset of the data. Since the documents are stored in *browser* memory accessing it is instantaneous because it's already pre-loaded

##Publications and Subscriptions
###Publishing
>Publishing handles sending data to the client.

###Subscribing
>By subscribing to data this specifies to the publisher which data that the
client wants to see at that given moment.
